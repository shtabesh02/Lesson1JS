    <h1>Welcome to class!</h1>
    <p>
      We're glad to have you in our program! First let's look around at where we
      are...
    </p>

    <h3>Where am I?</h3>
    <p>
      The site you're at is codesandbox.io. They are an online integrated
      development environment. Wow! That's a bunch of words! Let's unpack
      that... An "Integrated Development Environment" (called an IDE for short
      because that's a huge name) is a space developers use to have all their
      tools visible at once and easy to jump between so they can work quickly
      and effectively. Codesandbox runs through your internet browser window
      which makes it an online IDE. Later in class you'll download, install, and
      use a software program that is an IDE that runs whether you're using your
      internet browser or not.
    </p>

    <h3>Codesandbox Interface</h3>
    <h4>What's an interface?</h4>
    <p>
      It's a place where a user interacts with a piece of techonology. There are
      a few main areas in within this interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>Explorer</strong> area to the left shows an index.mjs file and
      an index.html file where all of this content is written. For this exercise
      you only need to work with and edit code within the index.mjs file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>Editor</strong> section is in the middle and may already have
      a couple of tabs open. This is where you will be editing the index.mjs
      file. One thing that will likely look different from a normal text editor
      or word editor is that different portions of the code will be colored in
      different ways. This is called <strong>Syntax Highlighting</strong> and is
      useful when working in a code file to quickly identify the different parts
      of the code.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>Browser</strong> section on the right is where you are likely 
      reading this content. You will see a small button on the top right of this 
      window that looks like this (it may not have the red dot in the corner):</p> 
      <img src="../img/InspectButton.png" style="margin-left: 30%; height: 80px;"></img>
      
      
      <p>Click that icon and a panel will open below this Browser window with the 
        inspector (also known as developer tools) where you should be able to see your 
        console.log code you will write to test your code. Make sure you have the word 
        "Console" selected.  The console will be empty to start with.</p>
        
        <p>There are further details in the index.mjs on console.logs and how/where to 
          use them
          
        <h3>Instructions</h3> 
        You'll need to fork this code to get started, but don't do it yet! Let's 
        talk about what it means to fork
      code. Forking means making your own personal copy of a code base. Because
      your forked copy is your copy, you can write your code without other
      people also using the code base seeing your answers and work. You can also
      go back to your assignments and make any edits or review your work at any
      time. For the next several weeks you'll fork the coding assignment for
      each week of class to make your own copy. You can find your copies of
      these assignments by clicking on the codesandbox icon (small square in the top left) 
      in the top right of this website, then select "Dashboard". The Lessons you have forked
      should be right there in your dashboard under "Recent".
      
      
      <h4>Opening and Running Index.mjs</h4>
      If index.mjs is not already a tab available in the Editor part of the
      interface after you fork the assignment, double click on the index.mjs file
      name in the Explorer panel on the left to open it. When you write code in the
      index.mjs file, the code will not run until you have saved (or until your
      file autosaved). The results of running your code will be seen in the Console panel
      to the bottom right. Any errors in your code will display in red/pink in the Console panel. 
      
      <h4>Debugging</h4> 
      <p>In code, you don't want many - if any - bugs. Bugs can cause your code to NOT run as
      you expect or want. We call checking for these kinds of issues in your
      code and fixing them "debugging". You should use console.log to output
      values in the code to assist in debugging. For example, if
      you are having an issue with something related to the firstName variable
      you might add this line of code right below the variable to see what the
      actual value is at that point.</p> <code>console.log('firstName variable is: ',
      firstName)</code> 
      <p>Then check
      the output in the Console. We have console.log code written for your first
      few questions, but they are commented out so you won't have errors in your Console to start with.  
      When you've written your code, comment in (remove the <code>//</code> in front of the console.log) 
      so you can see what to do. Be sure you follow that pattern
      for all of the other questions. </p>
      
     <h4> Getting help </h4> 
     Refer to your lessons
      materials, contact class mentors, or reach out to your cohort leader(s) if
      you need any help. Happy coding! 
      
      <h3>Now you're ready to get started! </h3>
      Click the gray "Fork" button in the top right corner to make a
      copy of this starter code for yourself. Make sure your name and "(forked)" appear at the top center of the page to be 
      sure you're working within your forked copy of code. Double click the index.mjs file in the Explorer panel and start your assignment.
